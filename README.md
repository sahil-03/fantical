This is an app where users can talk to fun, personalized chat bots. Here is a list of cool features:

1. Create your own bot and give it its own personality (i.e. you can talk to Dumbledore by describing him as best as possible).
2. Generate random bots -- bots that automatically get an avatar, name, and personality.
3. Add intelligence to the bot by supplying information (pdfs) for extra context (under the hood, this uses a basic RAG implementation).
4. Tell it more about yourself (your name, age, gender, interests, ...) so you can have more personalized conversations.
5. Create group chats with multiple bots and yourself!
